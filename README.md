### Overview
###### Site description: 
> deCODE is an exclusive hackathon which invites selected students to work alongside company engineers to create innovative solutions to problems the companies themselves face.

Out of 500 applicants, I was one of the 21 handpicked students chosen to work along side the company engineers. I was chosen by the klipfolio team to help build a mobile web app that allows you to create new data visualizations alongside viewing your current ones. This was one of the problems they wanted solved since their current mobile web app does not allow you to create new data visualizations. Since their code is not open source, we had to build the web app from scratch over a short period of 16~17 hours. 

Our current build allows you to create new visualizations from chosen csv files. It allows the users to choose specific headers to customize the data they want displayed. The users are also able to delete visualizations they no longer want or to edit their colors and styling.

### Challenges 
> These were things that we were not able to complete due to time constraints

1. We wanted the product to be able to display live previews of multiple different visualizations based on the number of headers selected such as pie, line or bar charts.
2. Alongside the color editing, we wanted to be able to edit the visualizations data after creating it.
3. We wanted a more user friendly UI by allowing the edit and delete button pop up in a text bubble by tapping anywhere on the visualization itself.
